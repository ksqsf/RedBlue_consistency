transtion tables with a prefix "vasco" refer to files related to the vasco project
All these tables additionally have two entries: GetAuctionsReadyForClose and CloseAuction


vasco_transtions.xls is the first attempt
vasco_transtions_1.xls has a problem that the state CloseAuction will go back to itself again
vasco_transtions_2.xls reduces the errors introduced by the previous table
vasco_transtions_3.xls lowers the probability of executing close auction related interactions
